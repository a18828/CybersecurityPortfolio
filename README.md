# CybersecurityPortfolio
This Cybersecurity Porfolio is part of my training on "Foundation of Cybersecurity" from Google.

My name is Jorge Amaral. I currently work in a diffent area but currently I'm extremly interested in acquire skills in Cybersecurity. Every day new threats emerge that try to obtain personal assets and for this reason it is increasingly necessary to increase the number of people protecting the network.
My skills are related with SQL, programming, time management.
